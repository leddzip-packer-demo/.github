Since it will be used to create AMI backed by Elastic Block Storage volumes, so it can be used by ec2 access_key and private_key: will receive the variable defined prior the builder block. It uses a kind of interpolation with {{ }} region: the AWS region that we will use instance_type: here, micro.t2, no need for more yet. The base AMI that we will use will be launched with this instance type. Unless we are doing so compilation on the fly to install some package, we won\u0026rsquo;t need more ami-name: the name of the ami we will be creating source_ami_filter: this one is tricky. I was expecting a cold hard ref to the ami we will use like ami-0123456789. However, the tuto guide us in using a kind of filtering. Basically, those are the filter you can see when using directly the AWS AMI interface to search for AMI. Here, we give specific filters to target the latest (most_recent: true) base AMI from Canonical (owners: 099720109477), that have a name looking like ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*. There are additional filters like the kind of virtualization (hvm) and the root device type (ebs). Not sure however what they are used for (except filtering of course).
