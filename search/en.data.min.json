Currently there are 3 repos:\none for packer based AMI creation one for terraform using the create AMI to bootstrap an EC2 instance this site, using hugo, to document and log my journey Most of the repo are empty for now, excpet the one for my dev logging. The work done on it is:\nsetup of hugo locally setup of gh action to deploy this site into a gh-page theme configuration and content creation Some thoughs I am pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ll need a docker image with packer if I want to use it easilly. I could use it directly with a ubuntu runner and install packer in it, but it won\u0026rsquo;t fit the workflow I use with CircleCI (additionnally isolating the build env offers many benefits).\nFor now, hugo is fairly easy to use. A little derouting at the beginning (especially due to the theme I choosed), but once setup, it\u0026rsquo;s a very nice tool.\nReferences for further experimentation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57549439/how-do-i-use-docker-with-github-actions ","description":"The experiment is to work with packer to create a bew base AMI.\nWhat I have in hand: a bit of experience with terraform and HCL a bit of experience with AWS some practical experience with devops practices What am I targeting: a fully functional AMI with docker and docker-compose installed, build with packer once the AMI is created, use it to create an EC2 with terraform all build should be done through github action (I use heavily CircleCI in most of my projects, so let\u0026rsquo;s try something else once) a documentation of my progress using hugo (for fun and to learn as muck as possible along the way) Content of the day; Mostly setup of the projects and the different repos to hold the work on this experiment."},{"id":4,"href":"/","title":"Packer experiment / notes","parent":"","content":"","description":""},{"id":5,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Packer experiment / notes","content":"","description":""}]
