What I have in hand: a bit of experience with terraform and HCL a bit of experience with AWS some practical experience with devops practices What am I targeting: a fully functional AMI with docker and docker-compose installed, build with packer once the AMI is created, use it to create an EC2 with terraform all build should be done through github action (I use heavily CircleCI in most of my projects, so let&amp;rsquo;s try something else once) a documentation of my progress using hugo (for fun and to learn as muck as possible along the way) Content of the day; Mostly setup of the projects and the different repos to hold the work on this experiment.</description></item></channel></rss>
